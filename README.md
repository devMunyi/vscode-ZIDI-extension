# Stackoverflow Instant Search - Visual Studio Code Extension

You can find the command by name `ZIDI search` or by using the hotkeys `cmd+c` on Mac or `ctrl+c` on Linux/Windows, `c` stands for `code`. As an alternative you can execute search instantly from a context menu (select text -> right click -> Stackoverflow Search) or by using the hotkeys `cmd+shift+c` on Mac or `ctrl+shift+c` on Linux/Windows.
